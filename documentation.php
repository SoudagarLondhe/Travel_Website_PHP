        <h2>1. Improved Hover Effect (Improvement from Individual Part 1 feedback)</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the previous feedback regarding distracting size changes during hover interactions,
          I updated the hover effect for all Attractions pages (Empire State Building, Central Park, 
          Times Square, Statue of Liberty, and One World Trade Center). Instead of scaling the entire 
          content or button area, I limited the hover effect to only scale the image inside each 
          gallery item. This was achieved by applying a CSS transform: scale(1.1) on the .gallery-image-wrapper:hover img selector. 
          This ensures that only the image subtly zooms on hover, providing a more focused and smoother user experience without shifting 
          surrounding content.

        <h2>2. Original JavaScript Component</h2>
        <p>
          I implemented a typewriter animation using vanilla JavaScript that displays contextual welcome text on pages like index.html, history.html, arts_museum.html, and facts.html.
      Each page uses a data-message attribute to dynamically control the message without duplicating JavaScript code.
      The text appears character-by-character using setTimeout(), creating a clean typing effect that enhances user engagement.
      No external libraries were used â€” the feature is fully custom, lightweight, and reusable across multiple pages.

          <h2>3.DHTML Component</h2>
          <p>
            For all pages under the Attractions section (Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square, Statue of Liberty, and One World Trade Center), I implemented a responsive image carousel using custom JavaScript and DHTML.
          The carousel supports both desktop navigation via left/right buttons and mobile swipe gestures built with touchstart and touchmove events.
          Unlike fixed-step scrolling, the mobile swipe scrolls based on the actual gesture distance, creating a natural, app-like interaction.
          
          Additionally, a fade-in animation is applied to gallery images on scroll using DHTML techniques, improving visual flow and user experience.

            <h2>4. Modularization Using PHP Includes</h2>
            <p>
            To avoid code repetition and follow best practices, I modularized my website using PHP includes. I created two reusable files: header.inc.php and footer.inc.php.
            Every page now sets its own $pageTitle (and optionally $pageCSS) before including the common header and footer.
