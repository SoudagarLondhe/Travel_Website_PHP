                <h3>Time Your Trip Carefully</h3>
                <p>
                    Winter, spring, summer, or fall—each season in New York offers something unique.                     <b>Consider the weather, major events, and the crowds. </b>
                 However, avoid peak tourist season unless you're prepared for the crowds!

                <h3>Leave Your Car at Home</h3>
                <p>
                    The <b>subway is the most convenient and cost-effective way</b> to get around NYC. It operates 24/7, but be mindful of the schedules and subway lines. Walking is also a great option, as many attractions are close to each other. Don't forget to download a map of the subway system or a navigation app like Google Maps for easy routes.

                <h3>Save Money With Free Attractions</h3>
                <p>
                    New York is known for being expensive, but there are plenty of free attractions to enjoy! Many museums offer free days or free hours each month, and there are free public spaces like Central Park and Times Square to explore.                </p>

                <h3>Get Out on the Water</h3>
                <p>
                    Want to see the city from a new perspective? Hop on a ferry! The Staten Island Ferry offers stunning views of the skyline, and it's free! For a more scenic route, consider the Governor's Island Ferry or the Ikea Express ferry.                </p>

                <h3>Rooftop views are a must!</h3>
                <p>
                    For panoramic views of the city, head to a rooftop bar. You'll get breathtaking views without the expensive ticket prices of skyscraper observation decks. Some great spots include Harriet's Rooftop in Brooklyn and CloudM in Midtown.

                <h3>Wear the Right Shoes</h3>
                <p>
                    Expect a lot of walking. Comfortable shoes are essential, but be mindful of the weather and your activities. Sneakers are great for sightseeing, but if you plan to visit fancy restaurants or clubs, consider packing something dressier.                </p>

                <h3>Consider Getting a New York City Pass</h3>
                <p>
                    A City Pass can save you money on top attractions like the Statue of Liberty, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Central Park bike tours. Consider purchasing a flex pass for flexibility or an all-inclusive pass for a great value.            </div>
