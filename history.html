            <h2>üìú The Evolution of New York City</h2>
            <p>New York City was originally inhabited by the Lenape people, a Native American tribe that lived along the Hudson River, 
              relying on fishing, hunting, and farming. In 1624, the Dutch established a settlement called New Amsterdam, which quickly became a key trading post
               due to its strategic location. However, in 1664, the British seized control and renamed it New York in honor of the Duke of York. 
               The city continued to expand, playing a crucial role in the American Revolution, with events such as the Battle of Long Island and George Washington's retreat 
               from Manhattan shaping its early history.
              </p>
            
            <p>By the late 19th century, New York experienced an unprecedented wave of immigration, with millions of people arriving 
              at Ellis Island, seeking new opportunities. This period transformed the city into a melting pot of cultures, giving 
              rise to diverse neighborhoods such as Little Italy, Chinatown, and the Jewish Lower East Side. 
              The city's skyline also began to change during this era, with the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883 and the Statue of Liberty in 1886, 
              symbolizing hope and freedom for immigrants.
            </p>
            
            <p>During the 20th century, New York evolved into a global financial and cultural hub, solidifying its dominance in business, 
              arts, and media. Wall Street became the heart of the financial world, while Broadway established itself as the pinnacle of theater and entertainment. 
              The city played a key role in World War II as an industrial powerhouse, and by the 1950s, it had emerged as the center of modern art, literature, and jazz.
