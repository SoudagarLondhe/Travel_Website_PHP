                <h2>History</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Central Park's construction, based on the modified Greensward Plan from 1868, was led by designers Frederick Law Olmsted 
                    and Calvert Vaux, alongside various engineers, architects, and landscape experts. The project was challenging due to the 
                    park's rocky and swampy terrain, requiring extensive excavation, soil importation, and innovative machinery. By 1858, 
                    major work had begun, employing mostly Irish and European immigrant laborers under difficult conditions. Early features 
                    like The Lake and The Ramble were completed by 1860, while the Civil War did not halt progress. Disputes over cost and 
                    management led to Olmsted and Vaux's temporary resignations, but they were re-hired in 1865 to oversee the final phases 
                    of construction. By 1876, Central Park was officially completed, with new structures, roadways, and recreational spaces 
                    attracting a broad public audience.

                <p>
                    Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Central Park faced neglect, funding shortages, and increased commercialization, 
                    leading to its decline. Efforts to preserve its landscape, led by figures like Samuel Parsons and advocacy groups, helped resist 
                    large-scale modifications. However, it wasn't until the 1930s, under parks commissioner Robert Moses, that a major revitalization 
                    took place. Moses initiated large-scale cleanups, built new playgrounds, restored landscapes, and introduced modern amenities using 
                    New Deal funding. Despite further developments in the mid-20th century, Moses' approach faced criticism for prioritizing infrastructure over 
                    Olmsted's original vision. Central Park remained a vital public space, evolving through various restoration efforts to balance preservation with urban demands.
