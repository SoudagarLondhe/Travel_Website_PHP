                <h2>The Immigration Story of NYC</h2>
                <p>New York City has always been a beacon for immigrants seeking new opportunities. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, millions of immigrants arrived at Ellis Island, the gateway to America. These newcomers came from countries like Italy, Ireland, Germany, Russia, and China, bringing with them their cultures, traditions, and dreams.</p>
            
            <p>Neighborhoods like the Lower East Side, Little Italy, and Chinatown became cultural enclaves where immigrants preserved their heritage while adapting to life in America. The city's diversity is reflected in its food, festivals, and languages, making NYC a true melting pot.</p>
            
            <p>Today, NYC continues to welcome immigrants from all over the world. Over 3 million residents are foreign-born, representing more than 150 nationalities. This rich tapestry of cultures has shaped the city's identity, making it one of the most diverse and dynamic places on Earth.</p>
