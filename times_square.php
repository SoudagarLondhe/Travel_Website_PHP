                <br>
                <p>
                    Times Square, originally known as Longacre Square, was a commercial and residential district in the late 19th century. The area transformed significantly in 1904 when The New York Times moved its headquarters to the newly built Times Building, prompting the city's decision to rename the area as Times Square. The construction of the first electrified billboards in the early 1900s marked the beginning of its evolution into an entertainment hub, attracting theaters, businesses, and cultural institutions.

                    During the 1920s and 1930s, Times Square became synonymous with Broadway, vaudeville, and cinematic premieres, making it the epicenter of American entertainment. However, by the mid-20th century, the area saw a decline due to economic struggles and an increase in crime, leading to a period of urban decay. The bright lights and bustling energy were overshadowed by rising concerns over safety and deteriorating infrastructure.

                    In the 1990s, a major revitalization effort led by the city government and private investors transformed Times Square into a global attraction once again. Strict zoning laws, cleanup initiatives, and corporate investments helped bring back theaters, shops, and pedestrian-friendly areas. Today, Times Square is an iconic landmark, famous for its neon billboards, bustling crowds, Broadway performances, and the annual New Year‚Äôs Eve Ball Drop, attracting millions of visitors from around the world.
